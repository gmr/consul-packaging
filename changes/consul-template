consul-template (0.19.1-1) trusty; urgency=low

 * The runner's render event now includes the last-rendered template contents. This is useful when embedding Consul Template as a library. [GH-974-975]
 * Use the new Golang API renewer [GH-978]
 * Compile and build with Go 1.9
 * Add per-template option error_on_missing_key. This causes the template to error when the user attempts to access a key in a map or field in a struct that does not exist. Previous behavior was to print <no value>, which might not be the desired behavior. This is opt-in behavior on a per-template basis. There is no global option. A future version of Consul Template will switch the default behavior to this safer format, but that change will be clearly called out as a breaking change in the future. Users should set error_on_missing_key = false in their configuration files if they are relying on the current <no value> behavior. [GH-973, GH-972]
 * Ensure all templates are rendered before spawning commands [GH-991, GH-995]
