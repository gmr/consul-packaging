 * builder/azure: Add object_id to windows_custom_image.json. [GH-5285]
 * builder/azure: Add support for storage account for managed images. [GH-5244]
 * builder/azure: Update pkcs12 package. [GH-5301]

 * builder/amazon: Changes way that AMI artifacts are printed out after build, aligning them to builder. Could affect output parsing. [GH-5281]
 * builder/amazon: Split enhanced_networking into sriov_support and ena_support to support finer grained control. Use packer fix <template.json> to automatically update your template to use ena_support where previously there was only enhanced_networking. Make sure to also add sriov_support if you need that feature, and to ensure ena_support is what you intended to be in your template. [GH-5284]

 * communicator: Preserve left-sided white-space in remote command output. Make sure any scripts that parse this output can handle the new whitespace before upgrading. [GH-5167]
