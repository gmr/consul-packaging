consul-esm (0.3.0-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * The work of health checking and node probing will now be divided up amongst all ESM agents that share a consul_service/consul_service_tag/consul_kv_path combination. This is done by the leader using the KV store for coordination. The consul_leader_key field has been replaced by consul_kv_path, which is a path to a KV directory for a coordinating set of ESM nodes to share.
  * Added the node_probe_interval config field for controlling how often ESM will attempt to probe each external node.
  * Check definitions can now be updated in-place. [GH-17]
  * Fixed an issue where the coordinate loop would run constantly and burn CPU when there were no nodes to probe.
