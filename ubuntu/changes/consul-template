consul-template (0.19.5-1) bionic; urgency=high

  * The de-duplication feature was incorrectly calculating the hash of dependency values over an unstable encoding of the data. This meant that in most cases the templates were being re-written to KV and on all watching template instances every minimum update time (i.e. wait { min = X }). At best this was a lot of wasted work, in some cases it caused 100% CPU usage when template instance leadership was split. [GH-1099, GH-1095]
  * Fixed an issue where we waited unnecessarily for a child process to exit [GH-1101]
  * Initiating runner log level moved to DEBUG [GH-1088]

consul-template (0.19.4-1) trusty; urgency=high

  * The version of Consul Template is now taken into account when using de-duplication mode. Without bundling the version, it's challenging to upgrade existing clusters or run multiple versions of Consul Template on the same cluster and template simultaneously. [GH-1025]
  * Remove references to unsupported dump_signal configuration
  * Update vendor libraries to support Consul 1.0.0 changes for better test stability
  * Renew unwrapped Vault token (previously Consul Template) would try to renew the wrapped token, which would not work.
  * Do not sort results when ~near queries are used [GH-1027]
  * Handle integer overflow in exponential backoff calculations [GH-1031, GH-1028]
  * Properly preserve existing file permissions [GH-1037]
  * Compile with Go 1.9.2
  * The Vault grace period in the config is now set to 15 seconds as the default. This matches Vault's default configuration for consistency.
  * Add indent function for indenting blocks of text in templates
  * Allow additional colons in the template command on the CLI [GH-1026]
  * Add Vault Transit example for key exfiltration [GH-1014]
  * Add a new option for disabling recursive directory creation per template [GH-1033]
  * Allow dots in node names [GH-977]

 consul-template (0.19.3-1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug that would cause once mode to not exit when the file pre-existed on disk with the correct contents. [GH-1000]

 -- Gavin M. Roy <gavinr@aweber.com>  Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:00:00 -0400

consul-template (0.19.1-1) trusty; urgency=low

 * The runner's render event now includes the last-rendered template contents. This is useful when embedding Consul Template as a library. [GH-974-975]
 * Use the new Golang API renewer [GH-978]
 * Compile and build with Go 1.9
 * Add per-template option error_on_missing_key. This causes the template to error when the user attempts to access a key in a map or field in a struct that does not exist. Previous behavior was to print <no value>, which might not be the desired behavior. This is opt-in behavior on a per-template basis. There is no global option. A future version of Consul Template will switch the default behavior to this safer format, but that change will be clearly called out as a breaking change in the future. Users should set error_on_missing_key = false in their configuration files if they are relying on the current <no value> behavior. [GH-973, GH-972]
 * Ensure all templates are rendered before spawning commands [GH-991, GH-995]

  * Allow catalog service tags to use the .Contains function (GH-261)
  * Send the standard error of commands back over the standard error of Consul Template (GH-253, GH-254)
  * Allow specifying -v in addition to -version to get the version output
